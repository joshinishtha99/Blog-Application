## Introduction

I learnt django via corey schafer tutorials and on the way generated a very basic blogging application following the tutorial. Later on tried to emulate reddit by features such as credits for a user, upvoting or downvoting blogs. Added commenting feature over each blog with upvoting or downvoting blogs. I am now planning to add a search bar over the website to search for user or blog. After I would add a basic messaging feature between user however it would have no end to end encrypting which should be there. So it would be the next step. I used bootstrap for frontend.
